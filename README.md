### **AI-Powered Green Credit Scoring for SMEs, Farmers & Informal Workers**

HaliCred is an **AI-driven platform** that empowers small businesses, farmers, and informal workers to access affordable loans by proving their **climate-friendly practices**.

We turn **eco-actions â†’ GreenScore â†’ Cheaper Loans + Carbon Credits.**

## Why HaliCred?

Access to finance is one of the biggest barriers for small businesses in Africa. Traditional credit systems ignore climate-positive behaviors like:

- Using **solar energy** instead of diesel.  
- Practicing **sustainable farming**.  
- Switching to **biogas or clean transport**.

HaliCred solves this by assigning a **GreenScore** that reflects real environmental impact, verified through **AI + APIs + uploaded evidence**.

Banks can then use this score to **offer better loan terms**, while SMEs earn from **carbon credits**.
